        <br>
        The 121-year-old parent body has been committed to ‚ÄúEmpowerment of women through education‚Äù. 
        The Institution has a centurylong history of dedicated work towards making women educated and 
        self-reliant. MKSSS, Pune was established in 1896 by the great visionary and social worker Bharat
         Ratna Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve to provide shelter to destitute women.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The Founder of the Institution:</b>
        Prof. D. K. Karve founded an Institution in a village called ‚ÄúHingne‚Äù near Pune City. The Institution was named as ‚ÄúHingne
         Stree Shikshan Samstha‚Äù. Later, the Institution was renamed as ‚ÄúMaharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha‚Äù.
        
        Prof. Karve founded this Institution with an aim to uplift, emancipate and educate the destituted and downtrodden.
         Prof. Karve dedicated his whole life for this humanitarian cause with great determination and courage.  He was awarded
          ‚ÄúBharat Ratna‚Äù the highest national award for his sacrifice and dedicated social work and his contribution to the noble
           cause .
        
        On 14th June in the year 1896, in the village ‚ÄòHingne‚Äô near Pune city, Maharshi Karve started a ‚ÄúHome for Widows‚Äù,
         along with a school for Widows, so that they become educated and self-reliant. He fought throughout his life to make 
         this happen. The ‚ÄúHome for Widows‚Äù was then named as ‚ÄòHingne Stree Shikshan Samstha‚Äô and the school was named as
          ‚ÄòMahilashram High School‚Äô.
          <br>
          <br>

           <b>Purpose of Establishment:</b>
          In the 18th century, social pattern in India was such that no women were going to schools for education. 
          With the purpose of upliftment , emancipation and education of women, who formed a major section of the 
          socially downtrodden, Maharshi D. K. Karve founded an Institution called ‚ÄúHingne Stree Shikshan Samstha‚Äù,
           in the year 1896. Prof. Karve dedicated his whole life for this humanitarian cause with great determination
            and courage.
